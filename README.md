# Python Multiprocessing
A simple project that shows how Python multi-processing works.

## Requirements
The project is all contained within four Jupyter Notebook files. You'll need a Python distribution that can run such Notebook files - this project was built using Anaconda.

In addition, several packages are imported and can be added (if not already added) by using `pip install <PACKAGE_NAME>`.

* `pandas`
* `os`
* `logging`
* `timeit`
* `sklearn.feature_extraction.text TfidfVectorizer`
* `multiprocessing Pool`
* `datetime datetime`

Finally, this entire project uses some very large files, which I opted not to upload into GitHub. You can get the files at:

Once downloaded, adjust the paths to those files in the Python code.

## Features
The project shows several different features, focused on illustrating Python's multi-procssing capabilities:

* Python multi-processing
* Logging
* Parallel corpus processing, critical for text analytics
* Working with corpora for text analytics (not too deep)
* Some Google Cloud SDK / Spark coding (not meant as an introduction)

## Status
Project is: _finished_, since it's illustrative only.

## Inspiration
Inspired by Bellevue University's MS in Data Science program.
